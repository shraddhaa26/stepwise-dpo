# ðŸ¤– LLM Usage Disclosure

This project involved the use of GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) for the following tasks:

- Structuring the overall project and folder layout
- Generating templates for:
  - StepwiseRewardModel
  - Custom StepwiseDPOTrainer
  - reward scoring and aggregation
- Writing and improving documentation (README)
- Improving code readability and reproducibility

All final code was tested manually. No full files were blindly copy-pasted without review.

This transparency helps ensure responsible AI use in ML research and evaluation.
